### Example :

You can watch any icons by opening `demo.html` into any browser.<br>
You will see all icons names.

Example: [icon] icon-github

To use these icons, write:

- html standard

```html
<i class="icon-github"></i>
```

- html react

```js
<i classname="icon-github" />
```

---

### Custom :

To use it, place the `custom` folder wherever you want (in your project).<br>
On react, more like `/assets`, `/assets/fonts`, ...<br>
On normal, next to index.html ...<br>

You have to bind the `custom.css` with your app (as a `style.css` file) and that's all.

## Contains No Copyright, so use it as you want
